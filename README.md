# <div align="center">**ParCountMPI: Scalable Text Analytics using MPI and Docker across Native and Docker Environments**</div>

<br>

## üìù Abstract

<div align="justify">

This project, ParCountMPI, presents a scalable solution for analyzing large-scale text files by counting the frequency of words and characters. The system leverages MPI (Message Passing Interface) to enable parallel processing across multiple nodes and evaluates performance in both native environments and containerized Docker environments. The implementation is designed to measure scalability by varying the number of processes or containers, providing insights into execution efficiency under distributed computing frameworks. The project emphasizes not only correct word and character frequency analysis but also evaluates the impact of containerization on parallel computing performance.
